mutation-finder
===============

This program takes in a file(either txt , csv, or xlsx) of protein Accession Ids, mutation Indexes, and mutation changes(PeptideChange/PeptideChange) and writes the full protein, the mutation sequence( with 8 letter padding on each side), the corresponding regular sequence, and the top SYPFEITHI of both.
